# AI-Based-Content-Moderator


**Overview**

The AI-Based Content Moderator is a machine learning-powered system designed to identify and filter offensive, harmful, or inappropriate content across online platforms. This project employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, leveraging deep learning models such as BiLSTM, FastText, DistilBERT, Google BERT, RoBERTa, MuRIL, and mBERT to detect hate speech, offensive language, and targeted harassment.
This project is part of an ongoing research effort, and the associated research paper is scheduled for publication in May. The dataset used for training and evaluation was obtained from a Shared Task dataset, ensuring benchmark-quality data for model evaluation.


**Features**

‚Ä¢	Multi-Model Approach: Utilizes various transformer-based and deep learning models for content moderation.

‚Ä¢	Fine-Tuned & Non-Fine-Tuned Models: Includes both fine-tuned and pre-trained versions of BERT-based models for comparative analysis.

‚Ä¢	Multilingual Support: Implements MuRIL and mBERT for handling multiple languages.

‚Ä¢	Hate Speech Detection: Classifies content into different categories such as offensive, abusive, or neutral.

‚Ä¢	Target Identification: Determines whether a piece of text targets an individual, group, or organization.

‚Ä¢	Subtask-Specific Processing: Handles different moderation tasks separately to improve accuracy and reliability.

‚Ä¢	Bias Mitigation: Incorporating fairness-aware AI strategies to minimize bias in classification.

‚Ä¢	User Feedback Loop: Enabling a self-learning mechanism where flagged content is reviewed and used for continuous model improvement.

‚Ä¢	Edge AI Deployment: Optimizing models for deployment on low-resource devices and mobile applications.

‚Ä¢	Integration with Existing Systems: Enhancing compatibility with platforms such as Discord, Reddit, YouTube, and Instagram.


**Dataset**

The dataset used for training and testing was collected from a Shared Task, ensuring a high-quality and diverse dataset for hate speech detection and content moderation.


**Conclusion**

The AI-Based Content Moderator project presents a powerful solution for detecting and filtering offensive content using state-of-the-art deep learning and NLP techniques. While the project achieves promising results, further work is needed to address challenges such as bias mitigation, computational efficiency, and real-time deployment. The project serves as a stepping stone towards more robust and responsible AI-driven content moderation solutions.
